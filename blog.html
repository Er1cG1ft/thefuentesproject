        It starts with the movement

      <p>
        I&#39m trying to create the watch I have always wished existed. <br>
        <br>
        It goes like this:<br>
        <br>
         - Modest proportions <br>
         - Bauhaus and/or Art Deco aesthetic <br>
         - Robust movement <br>
         - Robust case <br>
         - Fine materials <br>
         - High quality finishing <br>
         - Accessible (less than USD1000) pricing <br>
        <br>
        Believe it or not, no one has made that yet. So I decided to do it myself. <br>

        I started with movement selection. The movement refers to the internals of the watch. Most watch purists enjoy mechanical movements, in which all timekeeping is provided by the interactions of springs and gears. I am no different: for my watch, I selected the venerable Miyota 9015, an upper middle tier movement with accessible pricing. <br>

        In order to design a case around the watch, I first had to model the movement in 3D. I downloaded the technical drawing for the 9015 from Miyotaâ€™s website (visit here if interested) and got to the task in SOLIDWORKS. <br>

        The model below is what resulted. No frills, no gears shown, just the frame around which I will build my watch: The Fuentes Watch. <br>
